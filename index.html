      <h1>Creating a Progress Bar Without Bootstrap.</h1>
    </nav>

    <body>
      <section>
        <p>This is a brief look at how to make a progress bar in HTML and CSS only. I didn't want to use the pre-made Bootstrap examples because Bootstrap somehow felt like cheating. Because it is cheating. If I can hand-write this, you can too.
         Turns out it was far less pain than I thought it would be. Here are the steps I took. I can't tell you this is the right way, but it works for me.</p>
        <h2> Step 1. Bar for the course.</h2>
        <p>All of the stuff I've half-read (no one reads a full book) about development all come down to a simple maxim. <b>Do the easy things first.</b> For me, this was to create an empty "bar", and completely fill it.</p>
        <p>So I created an empty section, "progress-bar", and give it a background color. Add some padding to that, and you get a passable "bar" type thing. Once you add in a border, it doesn't look too bad.</p>
          <section class="progress-bar">
            <div></div>
          </section>
        <p>And here is the pretty basic HTML/CSS for that bar above <br>

          <h2>Step 2. Progression</h2>
          <p>Progress bars are rarely full. Afterall, they indicate progress, not achievement. I spent a long time trying to achieve this with an internal div, and margins. It didn't work and would be fiddly if it did. So I turned to gradients instead.</p>
          <p>At first, I couldn't get it to stop fading like a 1990's shell suit top. But I changed the % values until it worked. Here it is.</p>
            <section class="progress-bar-2">
              <div></div>
            </section>
            <p>You can see the gradient rule at the end:</p>

            </section>
            <p><b>NB. This may not work on old Internet Explorer. But if you need to care about that you're getting paid more than me, so you'll have to sort yourself out.</b></p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Step 3. To progress, you must go backwards</h2>
          <p>What's past is prologue. Shakespeare said that, and it somehow seems relevant to realising you've done something... sub-optimal.<br>
            I had been creating new a new class for every variation. I realised that I could actually have one class to control the common themes (width, height, border) and IDs to control the color and the % of the gradient.</p>
            <section class="progress-bar" id="good">
              <div></div>
            </section>

            <p>You can see that the progress-bar rule doesn't have a color. The ID selector does. So, do that. Also,ignore the empty DIVs. I put them in to try something out and it failed. So don't use them.</p>

        <section>
          <h2>Step 4. The long march of progress</h2>
          <p>That's it. Change the colors and % as you see fit. Just make a new rule for each id you make and see what happens. Here's the #good the #bad and the #ugly, below.</p>
